Bitcoin Core integration/staging tree
=====================================

We keep this version of Bitcoin in our repository because that's from where we fork Kryptofranc. We will update this folder with the latest version of Bitcoin we update Kryptofranc with.

Kryptofranc is designed to be almost automatically sync with Bitcoin Core. But Bitcoin core is updated every day, and we cannot re-fork at every release. 

So that is the solution that we have found.

If you want to have the final version of the modified fork, it is located in /kryptofranc/kryptofranccore/
